# Book Library

## Description

This application is a book library inventory system which allows the user to add and store all of the books in their library. The user can also add books that they want to purchase in the future as a wishlist item. The user can also delete a book if they sell or give away the book from their inventory.

As a team we have conceived and executed a design that solves a real-world problem. By creating our first collaborative full-stack application, we have combined a robust back-end with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authentication to an intuitive front end. We have continued building on the agile development methodologies that we have used throughout our fullstack boot camp, like storing our project code in GitHub, managing our work with a project management tool (miro), and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.

This project includes the following features:
Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API,Handlebars.js as the template engine, MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database, GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data, user authentication (express-session and cookies), protected API keys and sensitive information with environment variables, deployment using Heroku (with data), a polished and responsive UI.
